Zero System is designed to be cloned and modified and again cloned and modified. Every clone is capable of exporting assets that may be used by other Zero System clones and Web Applications in general.

Most important to keep in mind is that Zero System is designed to be compatible with the wider Open Source Community and Open Standards and specifically intended to bridge the gap between existing technology and the declarative composition future by making it work **today**.
