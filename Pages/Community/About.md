Zero System and the Zero System Community is benevolently dictated by [Christoph Dorn](http://christophdorn.com) to accomplish his quest of *binding a software ecosystem that uses existing open source software as reusable components that are declaratively assembled into applications and maintainable long-term*.

Zero System is about building a common platform for decalarative system composition by leveraging a world-wide pool of open source developers and communities for the benefit of all.

Everyone can have a clone of ZeroSystem and can test their changes against any other clone. Any advances made in any part of the Zero System clone network can eventually make it to every other part of the active network.

Zero System is as good as the conduct of the individual participants of the Zero System Community. We expect only the best open source behavior patterns by all human and machiene participants. Our bots are ruthless in enforcing the principles of Zero System as they act based on cryptographic contracts you agree to every time you participate in the Zero System Community.
